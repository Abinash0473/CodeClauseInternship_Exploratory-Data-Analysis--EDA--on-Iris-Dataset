# CodeClauseInternship_Exploratory-Data-Analysis--EDA--on-Iris-Dataset
Exploratory data analysis on the famous Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between features.

## Project Aim

The primary aim of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and examine relationships between various features.

## Project Description

This project involves using Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries to explore the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 150 observations of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species label.

### Objectives:
- To visualize patterns, distributions, and relationships between different features of the dataset.
- To gain insights into the structure of the dataset, identifying any trends or anomalies.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For creating aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics.

### Additional Technologies:
You are encouraged to use any other relevant technologies that you are familiar with to enhance the analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will gain proficiency in:
- Data manipulation using the Pandas library.
- Creating a variety of visualizations to uncover patterns in the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Understanding the application of exploratory data analysis in real-world datasets.
